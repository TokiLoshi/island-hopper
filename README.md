- [ ] Create Globe starter
- [ ] Choose Islands of interest
- [ ] Choose models for each island
- [ ] Create companion to go with you to each Island (choose a animated C0 model)
- [ ] Create a dialogue animation to explain what to do
- [ ] Create routes for each Island
- [ ] Create points of interest on starter globe
- [ ] On click on those points generate a fly to animation to zoom in and then load next route
