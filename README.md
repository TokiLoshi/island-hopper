# Island-hopper

![IslandHopper](https://github.com/TokiLoshi/island-hopper/blob/main/public/githubReadme.png)
Welcome to Island Hopper, a 3D map experience taking you on a tour of islands around the world. Visit 6 unique islands, each with a character guide sharing interesting facts about these special places.
Discover beautiful landscapes, find hidden easter eggs, and learn odd facts about our amazing world. From active volcanoes to endangered paradises, each destination offers something different to explore.
Built to learn Next.js with R3F, Mapbox integrations, and 3D techniques. I had quite a journey, and definitely need more practice with physics, so adding that to the future roadmap. I hope you enjoy your journey!

# Stack

Next.js starter kit by [pmndrs](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next)
Mapbox with [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api//) including the snow and rain shaders, and helpful tutorials.
GLTFJSX file converter by [pmndrs](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/)
Zustand, R3F, Rapier, React Spring, Leva, Perf. Made for Three.js Journey Challenge #17.

Voiceovers generated with 11labs, copy for dialogs generated and researched by the developer with full recognition the humour may have been better having let the AI take point there.

The goal was to learn how to use Next.js with R3F, integrate Mapbox and practice techniques and new skills.

Known bugs: the volcano's physics did not turn out as expected, it is something I'd like to work on in the future.

### Komodo

The Komodo National Park can be found on volcanic islands and is home to 5,700 giant "Komodo Dragon" lizards Varanus Komodoensis that grow to an average of 2 - 3 meters. This is a UNESCO site.

### Farallon

Also known as "The Devil's Teeth". It is inhabited by researchers, and is not open to the public. The islands have strong winds and swells and is often surrounded by dense fog. It's been attributed to 400 ship and aircraft wrecks. It is also famously home to large numbers of great white sharks.
